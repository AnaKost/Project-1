    <h1>Phobos</h1>
    <p>This moon orbits only a few thousand miles above Mars' surface.  Its
      proximity to Mars is one of the reasons why astronomers were unable to see
    the satellite until the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.  In fact Phobos is
    getting closer to Mars over the centuries and will eventually breakup or
    get pulled into the Martian surface. Images from the Mariner 9 spacecraft
revealed the both Phobos and Demios have lumpy potato-like shapes rather than
the spherical shape like most moons.  Observations of Phobos were limited by the
tidal locking of the moon to the planet, resulting in the same side always facing
outward.</P>
<h1>Doomed Moon</h1>
<p>Phobos won't orbit around Mars forever.  The "doomed"moon is spiraling inward
  at a rate of 1.8 centimeters per year.  Within 50 million years, the moon will
  either collide with its planet, or it will be torn into rubble and scattered
  as a ring around Mars.  The unusual characteristics of Phobos including its
  decaying orbit led some scientists in the 1950's and 1960's to conclude that it
  was artificial.  Further examination revealed that the moon bears stronger
  resemblance to a rubble pile than an artificial satellite.</p>
